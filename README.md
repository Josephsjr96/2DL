# Universität Trier Helpdesk Chatbot

A modern, interactive web-based chatbot designed specifically to assist prospective and current students of **Universität Trier** with questions about admissions, programs, deadlines, international student support, campus life, and more.

This project was developed by **Yousef Sanjari** as part of a portfolio for the **M.Sc. in Natural Language Processing** at Universität Trier, demonstrating practical skills in conversational AI, user interface design, and applied natural language understanding.


## Features

- **Official Trier branding** (colors, university-specific content, real links)
- **Smart rule-based intent recognition** with broad keyword matching and synonyms
- **Quick reply buttons** for the most common applicant questions
- **Typing indicator** for realistic conversation flow
- **Admin connection modal** for complex queries (simulated live advisor)
- **Fully client-side** — no backend or external APIs required
- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Live Demo

Open `University ChatBot.html` in any browser to try it instantly!

## How It Works

- The user types a question or clicks a quick reply.
- The bot uses enhanced keyword detection to identify intent (admissions, deadlines, NLP program, etc.).
- Responses include accurate information and direct links to official Trier pages (PORTA portal, International Office, program details).
- For questions outside the knowledge base, the bot offers to connect with a live advisor.
- Always helpful — no "I don't understand" messages.

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom styling with animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `University ChatBot.html` in any modern browser
3. Click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner to start

No installation required!

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate a lightweight LLM (e.g., via Hugging Face Inference API) for more natural responses
- Add multilingual support (English, German, Persian)
- Connect to real university APIs/databases
- Deploy as an embeddable widget on the official Trier website
